1. Product Overview
One-Sentence Description:
AI Home Companion is a mobile + web app that helps homeowners maintain, repair, and optimize their homes through automated reminders, AI-powered assistance, property data integration, and smart home connectivity.
Primary Goal of MVP:
Enable homeowners to onboard quickly, receive personalized maintenance reminders, and use AI (chat + image analysis) to manage home issues.

2. Target Users
Primary Users: Homeowners (first-time and long-term) who want an easier way to manage property upkeep.

Secondary Users: Landlords, property managers, renters (in future versions).

3. MVP Features (Must-Haves)
3.1 Onboarding & Home Profile Setup
What it does: Collects property basics (location, square footage, year built, number of rooms, etc.) through simple Q&A or address lookup.

Why it matters: Creates a customized baseline for reminders and property data integration.

How it works:


User enters home address.


App fetches public data (Zillow/public records) to autofill property details.


User confirms or edits details.



3.2 Property Data Integration
What it does: Imports property value, tax history, square footage, lot size, and other available public records.


Why it matters: Reduces manual entry, ensures accuracy, and personalizes tasks.


Data Sources: Zillow, county assessor databases, municipal building records, MLS APIs (if available).



3.3 Maintenance Reminders & Task Scheduler
What it does: Provides automatic reminders (e.g., “clean gutters before first freeze,” “replace HVAC filter every 90 days”).


Why it matters: Prevents costly issues, helps homeowners stay proactive.


AI Add-On: Adjusts reminders by season, weather, and location (e.g., heavy rainfall = gutter cleaning sooner).


User Control: Users can snooze, mark complete, or customize reminders.



3.4 Photo Upload & AI Analysis
What it does: Lets user take/upload a photo of a home issue (e.g., a water stain, broken tile, lawn patch). AI suggests:


DIY fixes (step-by-step)


Needed tools/materials (with product links)


When to call a pro


Why it matters: Adds a visual layer of help beyond text.


Integration: GPT-powered vision APIs (e.g., OpenAI Vision).



3.5 Smart Home Integration (Phase 1)
What it does: Connects to major smart home platforms (Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa/Ring).


Phase 1 Scope:


Read device status (battery low, connectivity issues).


Surface basic alerts (doorbell activity, smoke alarm trigger).


Why it matters: Makes app a “single hub” for home upkeep.



3.6 AI Chatbot Assistant
What it does: Allows natural-language Q&A about home maintenance.


Example queries:


“When should I winterize my sprinkler system?”


“How do I fix a running toilet?”


“What’s the average roof lifespan in Connecticut?”


Why it matters: Turns the app into a personal home consultant.


Integration: OpenAI GPT API (or other LLM API).



4. Future Features (Nice-to-Haves / Phase 2+)
Pinterest-style design inspiration board.


Thumbtack integration (hire pros directly).


Amazon/retailer product links for repair parts.


Renovation planner & budgeting tools.


Neighborhood permit & inspection tracker.


Mortgage/refinance optimization suggestions.


IoT automation (advanced smart home routines).



5. Success Metrics (MVP)
The MVP is successful if:
A user can onboard in under 3 minutes with just an address.


The app automatically generates at least 5 personalized maintenance reminders within the first week.


Photo analysis produces a useful suggestion 80% of the time.


Chatbot can answer 10+ common homeownership questions.


At least 70% of users return once in 30 days (engagement metric).



6. Technical Considerations
Platforms: Start with mobile-first web app (accessible in any browser, later convert to native iOS/Android).


Backend: Open-source frameworks (Node.js/Express or Django/FastAPI).


Database: PostgreSQL (structured property/user data) + possibly MongoDB (flexible logs, photos).


AI APIs: OpenAI GPT & Vision; open-source alternatives (HuggingFace, LLaVA).


Integrations: Zillow API, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa APIs.


Hosting: Open-source-friendly cloud (Render, Railway, or AWS free tier).



7. Risks & Constraints
Data accuracy risk: Public property data may be incomplete or outdated. Need user validation.


AI accuracy risk: Image analysis may misclassify issues; must provide disclaimers.


Integration limits: Some APIs (e.g., Apple HomeKit) have strict approval processes.


Scope creep: Strong need to defer “nice-to-haves” until after MVP launch.



8. Next Steps After PRD Approval
Finalize MVP feature list (lock scope).


Choose open-source tech stack aligned to features.


Build clickable wireframes (UI/UX prototype).


Set up GitHub repo & project structure.


Begin backend + frontend scaffolding.
